A proof type that allows composition, mapping (probably a monad)
- Separate equivalence (reversible/nestable) and implication proofs
- Generic variables that allow matching and replacement

Main method that has
- Premises to conjunction (?)
- To/from DNF equivalence proof
- DNF datatype to contain two sets of clauses, with conversion to normal WFF and Proofs
- DNF clause expansion
- DNF clause removal
